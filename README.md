Hello World! 

This is my 2020 revision of abstracting OpenGL in C++.

My main take for this revision is to focus on creating a stack of scenes which showcase different approaches to implementing OpenGL features.

This current project utilises GLFW, GLEW, GLM, IMGUI, ASSIMP and STB_IMAGE C++ libraries.
